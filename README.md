*Description :-*

In this task, I worked on understanding and implementing different types of SQL joins using sample employee and department tables. This practice was aimed at strengthening my knowledge of how relational databases work and how data can be meaningfully combined using various types of joins.

To begin with, I created two sample tables: emp (employee) and dept (department). The emp table contains fields such as employee ID, name, email, phone, gender, date of birth, salary, and department ID. The dept table includes department ID, department name. A foreign key relationship was established between emp.did and dept.did, representing that each employee belongs to a department.

Once the tables were created, I inserted sample data into both tables , then i wrote SQL queries to perform and test four different types of joins:

1 . INNER JOIN
2 . LEFT JOIN
3 . RIGHT JOIN
4 . FULL JOIN
